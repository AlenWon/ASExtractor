Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPONs) are regarded as an important technology for current access networks. However, EPONs perform poorly in differentiated service environments, and may therefore fail to meet the Quality of Service (QoS) demands of emerging triple-play services (i.e. Voice over IP, video and BE traffic). Accordingly, the present study proposes a novel Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) scheme, designated as Frame-Oriented Interleaved Polling with Adaptive Cycle Time (FIPACT), to improve the differentiated QoS capability of EPON networks. In the proposed scheme, the Optical Line Terminal (OLT) divides the time domain of the upstream network bandwidth into a contiguous series of fixed-length frames. Within each frame, each Optical Network Unit (ONU) is guaranteed sufficient network resources to transmit a specific quota of each triple-play service. In this manner, the proposed DBA scheme can satisfy the differentiated QoS requirements of triple-play services. Therefore, based on the M/G/1 queueing analysis framework of multiuser cyclic polling systems, this study develops an analytical framework to derive the closed-form expressions for FIPACT mean packet delay. The simulation results validate the analytical results and confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed DBA scheme.
