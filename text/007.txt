This study establishes an information system of the wetlands and lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We sort up on the wetlands and use Visual Basic 6.0 for the management and development of MapObjects, and the ArcSDE pattern to place the spatial and attribute data into the Microsoft SQL Server relational integrated database. We demonstrate how this Wetland Information System, containing all the characteristics of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, can be applied to help manage the lakes and wetlands of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in a sustainable manner.
